# Akamai Client-Side Protect Compliance Script

## Overview

This repository contains a script to interact with the Akamai Client-Side Protect Compliance API, specifically to get PIM (Protect Information Management) configuration event groups. The script uses credentials stored in a file named `creds.txt` to authenticate.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests, json and edgegrid` libraries
- Akamai API credentials

## Usage

To run the script and get the CPC events, use the following command:
```sh
python3 fetch_cpc_events.py
```

## Script Details

The script reads credentials from `creds.txt`, makes a request to the Akamai Client-Side Protect and Compliance API

## Example

Below is an example of the output:
```
{
    "eventGroups": [
        {
            "groupId": "12345",
            "groupName": "Example Event Group",
            ...
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
